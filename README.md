This is a dataset about keyboards, created from web scraping Skroutz.gr.

### Skroutz.gr
Skroutz.gr is a very popular Greek online store. 
We scrapped the keyboard data from the html components on the site's pages.

### Tools

* For the http request, we used python's urllib.

* For data cleaning we used pandas
